# About node-4-beginners

This is a simple Express.js/Socket.io app I developed for a Node.js introduction workshop at IFSUL, in Passo Fundo, Brazil.
It aims to cover a bunch of Express.js concepts and the very basics of Socket.io, taking a practical approach.

## Topics coverd:

* Serving static files
* View engines setup
* Routing
* Request data parsing
* Code splitting and organization
* Simple real time with Socket.io

Hope it helps.
